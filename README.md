These are some mathematical games that I wrote. Most of them I invented myself.

`days.py` is a game that teaches you how to calculate the day of the year. It gives you a random date, you enter what day of the week that was, and it keeps track of how many you get right. If you ask it for help, it will give you a formula to use for the calculation.

`geek.py` is a mathematical-linguistic game I invented called Geek of All Trades. First you are told what type of math problem you are going to do. Based on that, you decide how many digits you want to work with, which determines the difficulty level. If one digit numbers are chosen, most grade school children should be able to solve the problems. Adults may need to choose more digits to keep this part of the game entertaining. After you type the number in, you're given a secret code to translate the numbers into letters, and you should make the longest word that you can out of these letters in order. The game can verify that you made a correct word in 12 languages. If you make a word in an unsupported language, it will ask you to score it yourself on the honour system.

`numberules.py` is a fun twist on "guess the number". Instead of guessing a number, you're given 3 numbers from a sequence of numbers and you have to try to guess the sequence. If you supply 5 numbers from the hidden sequences before you guess 10 numbers that are not in the sequence, you win. This is a fair ratio, because some of the sequences are quite difficult and there are a lot of possibilities.

`mastermind.py` is not my invention, I just coded it up for fun. You have to guess an n-digit number, and the computer tells you how many digits are correct and how many are in the right position.
